For over a decade, I've worked across the coffee value chain to help promote Specialty Coffee in the Philippines with our family business, Coffee for Peace (CFP). In partnership with PeaceBuilders Community (PBCI), CFP has worked on private and government-funded projects around the Philippines as management consultants or project managers. Our unique approach values people over profit and culture over brand. Our track record of training families to become to be self-sustaining and self-motivated small businesses has won us recognition nationally and globally.

In 2018, I became a husband and father and decided to take a break from CFP's day-to-day operations to pursue my interests in technology. I had hoped to find an e-commerce solution that was accessible to CFP and the farmers we worked with. For four years, I studied to become a web developer and made it onto an engineering team twice -- but I never managed to write a single blog about my experiences or code. Because I was always too busy learning or trying another eCommerce stack. But none of them check all the boxes.

Today, I came across Cococart through LinkedIn Job's, and I immediately went to your website to learn more. As I clicked through the sample shop the boxes were being checked. This is easy, it's accessible, it's basically automating the process they already do on their mobile phones! This is a tool I need to learn and teach to farmers asap!
